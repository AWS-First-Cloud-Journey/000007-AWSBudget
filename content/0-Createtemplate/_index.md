5. Verify your budget has been created successfully:

üí° **Pro Tip**: While templates provide a quick start, consider creating customized budgets for specific projects or departments using tags. This allows for more granular cost tracking and accountability across your organization.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**: Budget alerts are based on billing data that updates approximately every 8-12 hours. There may be a delay between when costs are incurred and when alerts are triggered.
