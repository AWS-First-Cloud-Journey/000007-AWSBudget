{{% notice warning %}}
**‚ö†Ô∏è Warning**: AWS Budgets relies on billing data that updates approximately every 8-12 hours. There may be a delay between when costs are incurred and when alerts are triggered. For the most critical workloads, consider setting conservative thresholds to account for this delay.
