5. Under **Utilization threshold**, for **Period**, choose how often you want the budget to reset the tracked utilization or coverage.

6. For **Monitor my spend against**, choose **Utilization of reservations** to track how much of your reservation you used. Or, choose **Coverage of reservations** to track how much of your instance usage is covered by reservations.

**RI Utilization** = total hours spent using reserve instances / total hours provisioned for reserved instances. RI Utilization helps you measure the effectiveness of using reserve instance. \
**RI Coverage** = total hours spent on reserve instances / total hours spent using the service has the same classification as the reserve instances. RI Coverage helps you decide how much reserve instance to purchase to get the most out of this pricing model.
